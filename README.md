### Have an Issue or Feature Suggestion?
Feel free to open an issue on GitHub, or contact me directly on Discord - my username is "mopzilla".
I most likely won't be doing major feature additions to this project though as I am busy with bigger projects, unless this site gets a lot of traction.

### Need Help?
This project was mostly made for personal-use, so there is a lack of instructions. I added placeholder text to the fields as a sort of hint. If you need more direct help though feel free to dm me on Discord at "mopzilla".

### Purpose of Spritesheet Animator
This tool was created to preview Realm of the Mad God spritesheets, as there isn't a viable way to view player or pet skins in-game. You can preview them by hovering in the store, but it doesn't always give a fair representation to gameplay. There are some skins with no in-game preview, like quest skins, where you would be reliant upon another user uploading footage of that skin.

### Want to Support me?
I would greatly appreciate my site being shared as it helps bring more attention to my work-in-progress portfolio on GitHub. If you spot someone who wants to know what a skin looks like, feel free to share the site to them or record the skin in question and upload it to them.

If you wish to support me financially [you can buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/mopzilla), or you can [donate items to me on Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/tradeoffer/new/?partner=118170564&token=r085WqK9).
